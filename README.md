In VacciCo19 , we are trying to build a website that will serve to the issue of :-
A) Misinformation regarding availability of oxygen cylinders, vaccine and other government policies
B) Help in providing accurate and most authenticate info regarding covid19 situation, cylinders, vaccine at a single portal.

-->As a nation we are struggling to help our near and dear find much needed medical facilities and much of it is due lack of knowledge of various policies of govt. Which are changed regularly given the situation, so our website will act as a tracker to change and provide everything in a structured manner.

-->The most important feature of site will be it would be regularly updated and provide region specific information to users.

-->We are building site just for covid19 but if successful can be generalized to a site that provide info about all government policies and schemes as its helps citizens better administratively use them.
